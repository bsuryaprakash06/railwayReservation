# Exp-3: Railway Management System

## AIM
To study and understand the design of a **Railway Management System** using UML concepts by identifying the main actors, use cases, and functionalities that manage train operations, bookings, and schedules.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)

### 1. Introduction
The **Railway Management System** is designed to automate and simplify the management of train operations, ticket booking, passenger details, and scheduling. It provides an organized platform for passengers, railway staff, and administrators to handle all railway-related activities efficiently.

### 2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that represents how the railway system handles operations such as train scheduling, ticket reservations, and passenger management through a digital process.

### 3. Scope
This system covers:
- Ticket booking and cancellation  
- Train and route management  
- Schedule management for trains  
- Passenger information handling  
- Staff and administrative control over operations  

---

### 4. Functional Requirements
- **User Registration:** Allows passengers to create and manage their accounts.  
- **Search Train:** Users can search trains by source, destination, and date.  
- **Book Ticket:** Enables passengers to reserve seats for a specific train.  
- **Cancel Ticket:** Allows cancellation of a booked ticket and initiates refund process.  
- **View Schedule:** Displays train routes, timings, and available classes.  
- **Manage Trains:** Admins can add, update, or remove train details.  
- **Manage Passengers:** Staff can view and verify passenger details.  

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** All transactions and passenger data must be securely stored and transmitted.  
- **Reliability:** The system must ensure accurate and consistent data at all times.  
- **Performance:** The system should handle multiple booking requests efficiently.  
- **Usability:** Interface should be simple for passengers and railway staff to use.  
- **Availability:** The system should be accessible at all times with minimal downtime.  

---

### 6. System Actors
- **Passenger:** Books and cancels tickets, views schedules, and searches for trains.  
- **Railway Staff:** Manages train data, monitors ticket availability, and assists passengers.  
- **Administrator:** Controls the entire system, manages staff, trains, and routes.  

---

### 7. Use Cases
The main use cases of the Railway Management System include:
1. Register User  
2. Search Train  
3. Book Ticket  
4. Cancel Ticket  
5. View Train Schedule  
6. Manage Train Details  
7. Manage Passenger Information  
8. Generate Reports  

Each use case defines the interaction between system actors and the system to perform a specific operation.
